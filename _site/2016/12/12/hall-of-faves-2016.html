<h2 class="title">Hall of Faves: Twenty-Sixteen</h2>
<h2 class="date">12 December 2016</h2></br>
  <p>Twenty-sixteen was insane. But I made some discoveries along the way that helped me navigate this crazy year.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p><b>Tomppabeats</b><br />
Harbor<br />
Favorite song: The Girl Next Door</p>

<p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A217LLrb47lzGE3HANjBLnn" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><br />


Tomppabeats has been the soundtrack to my life at home in 2016. "Harbor" is on the Sonos from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed. Every song on this album clocks in at a minute or less. They're like little nuggets of beats.  </p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Dean</b><br />
130 Mood : TRBL<br />
Favorite song: 21</p>

<p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A1MW3txTS49ZGvyLi0fziLU" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><br />


As soon as I was in the air and en route to Seoul this spring, Dean's music was EVERYWHERE. He was on the VOD on the airplane, cat cafes, shopping centers... you name it. I hadn't listened to Korean music since I was in middle school, but he made me take the plunge again. I was lucky enough to see him live in NYC in June, it was well worth the road trip!  </p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><b>Crush</b><br />
Interlude - EP<br />
Favorite song: 먼지 (Dust)</p>

<p><iframe src="https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Aalbum%3A2f9Pae8JWuf6kKpNhfOf8a" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe><br />


Crush is another Korean musician on my list.  The "Interlude" EP is one of the best I've heard all year. Sultry sounds? Check. Great production? Check. Songs I can turn up in the car to? CHECK! I also took the trip to NYC to see him live and it was my favorite concert of the year. </p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>TV</h2>

<p><b>Stranger Things</b><br /></p>

<p><img src="/img/strangerthings.gif" height="100%" width="300" /></p>

<p>What could I write about this that hasn’t been said already? Stranger Things is binge watching at it’s finest. It was the best thing I’ve seen all summer. Every hour was a thrill ride. And the soundtrack was badass. I’m excited to see where they take us in season two.<br /></p>

<p><b>She Was Pretty</b><br /></p>

<p><img src="/img/shewaspretty.gif" height="100%" width="300" /></p>

<p>In order for us to passively pick up some Korean before our vacation, Vincent and I binged watched a lot of K-dramas. She Was Pretty was our favorite. This drama is about childhood crushes losing touch after many years but reuniting under the strangest of circumstances. There’s also nothing like a good love triangle to keep me on edge. This drama is so good it got syndicated to Latin America which is how my mom got wind of it. She loved it. <br /></p>

<p><b>Literally anything on Viceland</b><br /></p>

<p><img src="/img/vicelandphone.gif" height="100%" width="300" /></p>

<p>Viceland came into my life via the cable box and I am so thankful. Finally a channel I can leave on all day and there’s quality programming every single hour. Favorite shows include Noisy, Huang’s world, Deadset on Life and Desus &amp; Mero.<br /></p>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<p><b>Bodega Boys</b><br /></p>

<iframe width="300" height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/298257001&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" style="margin-left:40px;"></iframe>

<p>Speaking of Desus and Mero, before they had their show on Viceland, I was cracking up at every single episode of their podcast, Bodega Boys. Hilarious commentary on politics, sports, pop culture and life in the Bronx. Gonna want to grab your headphones for this one: NSFW. #bodegahive.</p>

<p><b>This Week Had Me Like</b><br /></p>

<iframe width="300" height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/294871309&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" style="margin-left:40px;"></iframe>

<p>This podcast is 600 level college course on pop culture. Caroline covers topics from Stevie Wonder blind truthers, Dr. Drew’s potential singing career, Alyssa Milano’s paper towel collection and that’s not even scratching the surface. Each episode is well curated to bring you the most obscure celebrity news you can’t find anywhere else. I wish this podcast was weekly because I can not get enough. Also NSFW.</p>

<p><b>Who? Weekly</b><br /></p>

<iframe width="300" height="380" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/264347583&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" style="margin-left:40px;"></iframe>

<p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been in the grocery store line and seen a tabloid headline featuring a celebrity I don’t know, let alone care for. This is where Who? Weekly comes in. This twice a week podcast helps you go from “Wait, who?” to “Oh, her” with every episode. Thanks to this podcast, I probably know more about Rita Ora than I do my own self. You can find Who? Weekly on iTunes. (Ok, maybe all the podcasts I enjoy are NSFW.)</p>
