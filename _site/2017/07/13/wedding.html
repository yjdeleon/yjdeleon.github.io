<h2 class="title">V + Y Wedding</h2>
<h2 class="date">13 July 2017</h2></br>
  <p>
On May 25th, 2017, on our 6 year anniversary,  Vincent and I exchanged vows. </p>

<p>The morning started with me doing my hair and makeup at home.  Yes, I did it myself! </p>

<p>Some would say, "Omg I could never" but your girl was determined to come out looking radiant AF! My everyday makeup is already fairly minimal. So doing a big glam look just didn't feel right for me. I still wanted to look like myself with an extra side of "Damnnnn, girl you lookin' good".</p>

<p><img src="/img/wedding/hair_makeup.jpg" /></p>

<p>I did research the entire time I was engaged to see what foundation would work best with my skin type. I found what blushes had the best longevity. And what combination of eyeshadows I liked based on everyday wear. In the end, I assembled a bridal beauty arsenal. The three months before the wedding I practiced every single weekend and made sure to nail down the timing as well. That way I could do my makeup at a good pace, no problem.</p>

<p>Here's what I used that day:</p>

<h6><p><b>Skincare</b></p>
<p><b>Mask:</b> Tony Moly I'm Real Makgeolli Mask Sheet</p>
<p><b>Serum:</b> Innisfree Green Tea Seed Serum</p>
<p><b>Face Oil:</b> Khiel's Daily Reviving Concentrate</p>
<p><b>Moisturizer:</b> Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream</p>

<p><b>Makeup</b></p>
<p><b>Primer:</b> Clio Kill Cover Moist Tone Up Primer </p>
<p><b>Highlighting drops:</b> Algenist Reveal Concentrated Lumizing Drops in Pearl</p>
<p><b>Foundation:</b> Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Invisible Cover Foundation</p>
<p><b>Concealer:</b> A'PIEU Moist Creamy Concealer </p>
<p><b>Powder foundation:</b> TOO FACED Cocoa Powder Foundation</p>
<p><b>Cream blush:</b> H&amp;M Cream Blusher in Sunny Peach</p>
<p><b>Powder blush:</b> TOO FACED Love Flush Long-Lasting 16-Hour Blush in "I Will Always Love You"</p>
<p><b>Bronzer/Contour:</b> TOO FACED Chocolate Soleil Matte Bronzer</p>
<p><b>Cheek Highlight:</b> Stila All Over Shimmer Duo in Kitten</p>
<p><b>Lipstick:</b> CHANEL ROUGE COCO SHINE in Boy</p>
<p><b>Lip Liner:</b> Mac Lip Pencil in Subculture</p>
<p><b>Lip tint:</b> Peripera Ink Velvet in #8 </p>
<p><b>Lip gloss:</b> TOO FACED Sweet Peach Creamy Lip Oil in Pure Peach</p>
<p><b>Lashes:</b> Etude House Volume #2 lashes</p>
<p><b>Eyebrows:</b> Innisfree Eco Eyebrow Pencil in #2</p>
<p><b>Eyeshadows:</b> MAC Stroke of Midnight Eyeshadow Palette</p></h6>

<p>As for hair, I knew I wanted really soft waves, so that was very easy to pull off.  I purchased a curling iron off of Amazon and practiced, practiced, practiced as much as I could. The day of, I set everything with the OUAI wave spray and the OUAI medium hair spray.</p>

<p>I did not want to spend an arm and a leg on my wedding dress. I was wrapping my head around a look I wanted and I ended up ordering a beautiful gown online only to receive an email saying the dress was out of stock. Just my luck. So I continued my search for a couple more months with no success. Thankfully everything came together once I stumbled upon this dress. It was airy, simple and beautiful. Coming in at $179, I was instantly sold. It was way below my original budget! </p>

<p>My gray strappy heels I got at Nordstrom months back really came through on my wedding day. These were well broken in and at a comfortable heel height which proved to be crucial. It was raining heavily that day and needed shoes that were reliable so I wouldn't slip but were still really cute.</p>

<p>Our amazing friend Nicole is a talented AF floral designer. She followed her dreams and now has a kick ass business, Still Event &amp; Design, making the most beautiful arrangements. Nicole is an inspiration. With just one phone call and a few emails, she knew exactly what I was looking for.  </p>

<p>At the same time I was getting ready, Vincent was at the Envision hotel. If you're in the greater Boston area or are going to be soon, check it out. It recently opened in spring 2017 and is super nice.  </p>

<p>His tie...HIS TIE! We found this at our local Nordstrom and knew it was the one. So lovely, right?</p>

<p><img src="/img/wedding/bout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Vincent opted for a navy blue custom made suit from Indochino. The color really makes the boutineer pop.</p>

<p>Our ceremony took place at an event space right in the heart of Seaport District in Boston.</p>

<p>We managed to take a couple of "first look" photos before the ceremony started.</p>

<p>The ceremony itself was perfect. Short and sweet. We went for traditional vows since I knew if we were to write our own no one would have understood what I was saying over the sounds of me breathing and heavy crying. Who am I kidding? I cried regardless, lol. </p>

<p><img src="/img/wedding/ceremony.jpg" /></p>

<p>After our vows, we took some more quick pics with our friends and family, notably our little baby girl, Cammy. Have you been to a wedding before that had a kitty? Yeah. We are cat people.</p>

<p>Next stop was our lunch reception! </p>

<p>The folks over at Toro were so flexible and accommodating to our party.</p>

<p>The food was amazing, like always. </p>

<p>Instead of a cake, we went the cupcake route. Georgetown cupcakes are always a home run!</p>

<p>What I learned from being a bride:</p>

<p>1) Being engaged is fucking awesome. Enjoy it.</p>

<p>Vincent and I were engaged for a year and a half before we actually got married. In that time we focused on making our little apartment our home. A place where we can’t wait to come back after work and unwind. We traveled all the way to Seoul. Then months later to Toronto. We spent a lot of time just being together and in a way getting to know one another in different circumstances. I fell in love with him all over again.</p>

<p>2) Set a budget and stick to it.</p>

<p>I live by one rule when it comes to money. “If I can’t buy it now, I’m not buying it. Period. Not putting it on a credit card. If I really want it, I’ll save for it.” And that didn’t change when it came to my wedding. Vincent and I spent a good amount of time saving up for the wedding and honeymoon. Having a tangible amount as a goal to save up for really helped me set a budget weekly and it was easy to stick to.</p>

<p>3) This is YOUR wedding. Not anyone else’s. Do what makes you happy as a couple.</p>

<p>Because we wanted to keep the wedding small we knew we had to make some tough decisions. There were times where I would second guess my choices but I had to stop and think back to the reason we wanted a small wedding in the first place. I learned that there’s no right or wrong when it comes to weddings. We kept the ceremony small. But we’re still planning to throw a party to celebrate with more friends and family later on to mark our 100 days of marriage. Ultimately because we wanted to pay for everything, it was OUR decision.</p>

<p>Do what feels right for you. Don’t want bridesmaids? Cool. Want to treat your guests to a  7-course meal? Sure! Want a kid free wedding? By all means. No one should be stopping you on what you want on your wedding day.</p>

<p>4) Remember, your wedding is only one day out of an entire lifetime together. Try not to stress it.</p>

<p>There is an enormous pressure but on couples on their wedding day. That stress can feel so crushing at times. But to put it in perspective, it is just one day. Sure it’s a special day, but you have an entire lifetime ahead to share with our significant other. If one thing goes wrong, that’s ok. Keep your cool. At the very least it will add character to your wedding when you tell your grandkids the story.</p>

<p>5) Share your plans with friends and family once things are finalized.</p>

<p>Originally I had so many plans for my wedding. I wanted a destination wedding. Then things changed. And it happens…a lot! I wish I kept my mouth closed and waited until I had concrete plans and details to share with family. But parents are so curious to know what’s going on that I thought just adding the words “we were thinking about maybe…” would clarify that my wedding was still in the planning stage but no. Wrap up the key points and then share the info.</p>

<p>6) Have a backup plan. Then a backup plan for that backup plan.</p>

<p>If there’s anything I learned, it’s that the universe really likes to play tricks on me, SO I HAVE TO COME CORRECT.</p>

<p>Vincent and I originally had outdoor wedding plans. Three days before our big day we knew we had to bring the ceremony indoors. While we scrambled to find a venue, one of my vendors got sick and needed surgery and was not going to be at the wedding. The day before the wedding I got a call from Toro that their electricity needed to be shut off for 24 hours due to maintenance and that they might not be able to host us. On top of that, I had hit my head so hard on a glass fixture the night before by accident that I was starting to get a bruise on my forehead. IT WAS A FUCKING MESS, OK?! But because we kept the wedding small, I felt I could still handle it. I couldn’t imagine having all those issues happening on a bigger scale without having a huge emotional breakdown. I learned that I need to have a backup plan for every scenario. And then another backup plan for that, just in case.</p>

<p>7) Take the day before your wedding off.</p>

<p>Ok, this is a big one. I thought, “Yeah I’m literally having 15 guests. The wedding is so small. I don’t need a day off to plan beforehand.” I was so wrong. The day before my wedding was rough. I STILL WENT TO WORK because I was going on my honeymoon the next day after my wedding and had things to wrap up. I was going through a lot that day (see point 6 above) and on top of that I still needed to pick up the cupcakes, do my nails, my at home facial, I needed to give Cammy Cat a bath, clean the apartment, eat and sleep.  There are not enough hours in the day. I ended up sleeping for about two hours that night and feeling really lethargic on my wedding day. It also didn’t help that I couldn’t eat a thing because of the nerves. Take the day before your wedding off. Heck, do two days before the wedding if you can. Your body will thank you.</p>

<p>Phew, hope that advice helps at least one of you out there.</p>

<p>Before this post is over I just want to say a huge thank you to our families, our friends, our vendors and everyone who’s sent their best wishes over to Vincent and I. We really appreciate it and it means so much to us.</p>
