<h2 class="title">Japan, Korea and Birthday Hauls</h2>
<h2 class="date">3 July 2017</h2></br>
  <p>
As Lil' Kim would say, "I've been gone for a minute now I'm back with the jump off". I had a wedding (post about that coming soon) and honeymoon to plan and execute. But I'm here and ready to spill the tea on my beauty buys! There's a lot of stuff I picked up abroad on my honeymoon tour but I also splurged a little in the last week becasue why not treat 'yo self on your birthday? </p>

<h2>Japan</h2>

<p><b>Muji:</b></p>

<p><img src="/img/muji.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>
<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
Muji High Moisturizing Milk Lotion / Muji Cleansing Oil / Muji High Moisturizing Toning Water Toner / Muji Milk Cleanser / Muji All In One Essence / Muji Compressed Facial Mask Sheets<br />
</h6>

<p>I wouldn't say that my skin is necessarily sensitive but this line came highly recommended by a friend. I use this whole line at night as a base for my skincare routine and it's really soothing. The oil cleanser is the star of the show. I even like it better than the Tatcha cleansing oil. The essence has a gel consistency that is excellent as well. </p>

<p>Muji also carries little face mask capsules that when submerged in essences, ampoules or serums they expand and turn into a full sized sheet mask. Perfect for traveling or when you have extra essences laying around.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<!-- Don Quijote -->

<p><b>Don Quijote:</b></p>

<p><img src="/img/donki.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50+++ / DHC Lip Cream / Kose Lip Gel Magic / Rohto C3 Cube Aqua Charge Eye Drops / Silicone Sponge / Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam
<br />
</h6>

<p>The Nivea sunscreen is flat out amazing. It's not streaky, lightweight and easy to apply. Western sunscreens need to step up their game.</p>

<p> I'm also really liking the DHC lip balm. It's thick enough to apply lots of moisture to your lips without feeling overly sticky.</p>

<p>The Kose Lip Gel Magic balm was something I bought out of impulse. It promised to keep your lipstick on hours after eating, drinking...etc. It definitely extends the wear of your lipstick but I haven't used it enough to see how long it truly lasts.</p>

<p><img src="/img/eye_drops.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Japanese eye drops are on a whole new level. I even saw some slightly yellow tinted eyedrops to help combat the blue light from electronic devices...What a time to be alive, folks. I got the C3 eyedrops because of some great reviews online and I was totally sold on the cute and simple packaging. It makes wearing contacts actually enjoyable for me.</p>

<p>Silicone sponges are all over Instagram and I caved into the hype. I like to apply my foundation all over with this and then go in with some fine detail work with a disposable foam sponge. Two thumbs up for ease of cleanliness.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<!-- Daiso + It's Demo -->

<p><b>Daiso + It's Demo:</b></p>

<p><img src="/img/daiso.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
Daiso Impact Eyelashes #07 / Daiso Makeup Brush Cleaner / It's Demo x Missha M Magic Cushion #23 
<br />
</h6>

<p>Daiso and It's Demo are two completely different stores. Daiso makes all other dollar stores I've been to look obsolete. While It's Demo gave me vibes Claire's in the US might have given me. Except less middle school girls running around.</p>

<p>My mission at Daiso was to get my hands on the famous makeup brush cleaner that's always out of stock. I managed to get enough bottles to last me a while. On first use it left my makeup brushes squeaky clean. And at around 90 cents a bottle, you can't go wrong. In the same aisle I found some gorgeous and natural looking lashes. I stocked up on those as well.</p>

<p>There was an image that was surfacing around in the Asian beauty Instagram world. It was a picture of the cult classic Missha Cushion foundation with a limited edition Pokemon case. That's the only thing I walked into It's Demo for. I had to get my hands on it. First of all, the foundation itself is great on my skin and I ran out of it months back. Plus the packaging...I mean, COMMON, it's adorable. </p>

<h2>Korea</h2>

<p>My husband and I did a quick little visit to Seoul once again to shop ‘till we dropped. I ended up with old favorites and made some new discoveries.</p>

<!-- Innisfree -->

<p><b>Innisfree</b></p>

<p><img src="/img/innisfree.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br /> Innisfree It's Real Squeeze Masks / Innisfree Ampoule Moisture Cushion #23 / Innisfree Skinny Microcara / Innisfree Waterproof Skinny Microcara / Innisfree Auto Eyebrow Pencil /
Innisfree Jeju Scent Picker Candle Set
<br />
</h6>

<p>Your girl right here is a DIE HARD FAN of Innisfree. I grabbed a basket and just started filling it up as soon as I walked into the door. 
</p>

<p> The face masks themselves are ok. They're very thin so it makes absorption to the skin quickly but I also ripped part of it by mistake just trying to get it out of the pouch.</p>

<p>I live for the eyebrow pencils. They are smooth and make putting on my eyebrows in the morning a breeze. One pencil can last me up to 3 months! And I do my eyebrows almost every single day. It took everything in me to not get a lifetime supply all at once.</p>

<p><img src="/img/innisfree_cushion.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>My go-to winter cushion is the Ampule foundation from Innisfree. They had a 1 + 1 deal so of course, I put that in my basket.</p>

<p> The skinny mascara line is quite good. I like the original formula but also added in the waterproof one for good measure. The tiny wand gets all the mascara fibers into every single eyelash. </p>

<p>I almost didn't get the candle collection until my husband snuck up behind me and mentioned I should just get them. I'm glad I did. They smell amazing and look great!</p>
<p><br /></p>

<!-- Olive Young -->

<p><b>Olive Young</b></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
Clio Tinted Tattoo Kill Brow / Clio Tattoo Lasting Gel Pencil / Clio Kill Cover Foundation #4 Ginger
<br />
</h6>

<p>Olive Young was having wild deals store wide when I was there. I picked up a Clio foundation set on sale. It comes with the cushion foundation, a foundation refill as well as a primer.  I also came across some really good eyebrow products. My eyebrows stay in place when I use a combination of the two. Clio has some of my favorite Korean beauty products I've tried, these were no exception.
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<!-- Skinfood -->

<p><b>Skinfood</b></p>

<p><img src="/img/skinfood.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
 Skinfood Yuja Water Serum / Skinfood Gold Caviar Collagen Serum / Skinfood Nail Vita Nut Strengthener / Skinfood Nail Vita Pineapple Cuticle Cleaner / Skinfood Pine Nut Cuticle Oil / Skinfood Peach Cotton Pore Pact / Skinfood Mini Eyebrow Tools
<br />
</h6>

<p>We keep a giant tub of yuja tea in the fidge at my place. When I saw that Skinfood carried and entire yuja line, I couldn't wait to try it. I got the yuja serum and it smells amazing. I use it in the morning and night for an extra boost of hydration.</p>

<p> The gold caviar serum was mostly for my husband. He was in the market for night time skincare and he went with this as a serum option. More often than not, I reach out for this too. Can't help it. It smells wonderful and has little gold flecks so it feels ultra luxurious. </p>

<p>My nail beds tend to be weak and brittle but ever since I started using the nail strengthener, cuticle cleaner and oil I saw a change. My nails look and feel healthier. </p>

<p><img src="/img/skinfood_pact.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>I recently ran out of my peach compact and couldn't wait to get my hands on another one. It keeps the oil at bay during my work day and is small enough to throw in my makeup bag without taking up too much space. 
</p>

<p>I'm always keeping an eye out for small, portable tools that makes doing my eyebrows easier. These two little babies do the job so well! I can really blend out the edges and shape my brows with ease.</p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br />
 Nature Republic Hand &amp; Nature Sanitizer Gel / Nature Republic Hand &amp; Nature Sanitizer Hand Cream
<br />
</h6>

<p>I use both of these products every single day. I made sure to stock up for the entire year because these are my lifeline, particularly during flu season. If you're looking for a good sanitizer/hand cream duo, this is it! Plus the scents are subtle and not overwhelming like most western brands.

MAC x Steve J. &amp; Yoni P. Lipstick in Spotlight Me
<br />
</h6>

<p>The only thing I picked up at the MAC store in Korea was a lipstick. The most perfect shade of peachy nude I've ever seen.  It's called Spotlight Me and it's from the MAC collaboration with Korean Designers Steve J and Yoni P. The products on this line were meant to showcase "Seoul street style made easy...". I know this collection was released globally but getting my hands on it in Seoul made it feel really special. </p>

<b>Products above</b>:<br />
Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots / The Saem Saemmul Wrapping Tint in PK01 / Wet + Wild Perfect Pout Gel Lip Liner in Think Flamingos / Peach Slices Face Masks

</h6>

<p>Can we talk about the Peach &amp; Lily Peach Slices x CVS collection really quick? IT'S LIFE CHANGING. <a href="https://www.peachandlily.com/pages/peach-slices-where-to-buy">Go to your nearest CVS and stock up</a>. The products are totally cute and at an excellent price point. I'm so excited to see K-beauty become more accessible to everyone. There's a certain sense of comfort I get knowing I can pick up cold medicine, Doritos, and k-beauty products at the CVS next door. </p>

<p>I got some acne right on my chin and have been using the Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots to calm down the redness, soak up any excess sebum and get my skin back on track. I will definitely be getting more. </p>

<p><img src="/img/peach_slices_masks.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>The Peach Slices sheet masks are a pretty good quality for less than $3 each. The packaging is so cute too!  </p>

<p>Peel-off tints have been really popular on social media and I've been wanting to try them myself. The Saem Wrapping Tint can be a little messy to use at first but once you peel off the tinted gel, THAT COLOR PAYOFF THO! I like using it as a base for the rest of my lip products. But it can definitely be used on its own. The default color is a beautiful rose shade.</p>

<p>The Wet N' Wild lip liner is the perfect companion to the MAC lipstick mentioned above. It's almost a dupe, to be honest. I'm so happy I picked this up on a whim.  </p>
<p><br /></p>

<br />
</h6>

<p> I had my eyes on the YSL tint for a while now. I got it as part of a mini sample 500 point YSL kit at Sephora a long time ago but since it was my birthday month, why not splurge on the full size? It leaves lips looking juicy and supple.</p>

<p>The Supergoop setting SPF spray is something that I was on the hunt for. I wanted something that would help me reapply SPF in the middle of the day without having to use actual sunscreen and ruin my makeup. Shout out the amazing <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/natch-beaut/id1223715132?mt=2">podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/NatchBeaut/?fref=nf">beauty community</a> of Natch Beaut! They suggested this setting spray and it's just what I was looking for. I would not use this by itself as the only source of sunscreen and a setting spray. It does have its flaws but for reapplying SPF between my commute from the office to straight home, it's just the thing. </p>

<p><img src="/img/eyeshadow.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>Clinique eyeshadows were the first eyeshadows I ever owned. Why did I leave them? THEY ARE GREAT. I really wanted an everyday palette and this one looks so promising. </p>

<p>My skin has been acting up lately. But GLAMGLOW TO THE RESCUE. I've had great success with the clearing treatment mask, I'm hoping the cleanser also proves to be a good product to keep in my arsenal against acne. 
</p>

<p>Needed a new scent for summer and got the Elizabeth and James Nirvana White perfume. The hype is real. It's a luxurious scent. The rollerball is perfect to throw on a makeup bag and go!</p>

<p><img src="/img/shampoo.JPG" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

<p>For my oily haired babes, the Christophe Robin Cleansing Shampoo is the BEST SHAMPOO I'VE USED FOR MY OILY HAIR. PERIOD. Try this out! Got a sample of this in a Sephora Play box a couple of months back and I was so impressed how clean and lightweight my hair felt. I knew I need to go buy a bigger size. I use it once a week as a treatment. </p>

<p>The almighty K-Beauty queen, PONY, used a Buxom lippie in the shade "Hush Hush" in one of her tutorials recently and I had to get my hands on it. It's an awesome "my lip color, but better" shade. </p>

<br />
</h6>

<p>My wallet had a rough time keeping up with currency exchange on my honeymoon. I rarely use cash so having spare change, bills, subway cards, and random tickets on top of what I was already carrying popped the zipper on my old wallet. I desperately needed an upgrade. This simple wallet from Madewell can fit so much! When I was getting the wallet my eyes also wondered to a beautiful circular bag I wanted in my life. Perfect combo! 
</p>

<p>WOOOOO, ok. Haul complete. What have you've splurged on recently? Let me know in the comments below. </p>
