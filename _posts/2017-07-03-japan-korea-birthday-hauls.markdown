As Lil' Kim would say, "I've been gone for a minute now I'm back with the jump off". I had a wedding (post about that coming soon) and honeymoon to plan and execute. But I'm here and ready to spill the tea on my beauty buys! There's a lot of stuff I picked up abroad on my honeymoon tour but I also splurged a little in the last week becasue why not treat 'yo self on your birthday? </p>

<h2>Japan</h2>

<p><b>Muji:</b></p>

<b>Products above</b>:<br>
High Moisturizing Milk Lotion / Cleansing Oil / High Moisturizing Toning Water Toner / Milk Cleanser / All In One Essence / Compressed Facial Mask Sheets<br>
</h6>


<p>I wouldn't say that my skin is necessarily sensitive but this line came highly recommended by a friend. I use this whole line at night as a base for my skincare routine and it's really soothing. The oil cleanser is the star of the show. I even like it better than the Tatcha cleansing oil. The essence has a gel consultancy that is excellent as well. </p>

<p>Muji also carries these little face mask capsules that when submerged in essences, ampoules or serums they expand and turn into a full sized sheet mask. Perfect for traveling or when you have extra essences laying around.</p><br>

<b>Products above</b>:<br>
Nivea Sun Protect Super Water Gel SPF 50+++ / DHC Lip Cream / Kose Lip Gel Magic / Rohto C3 Cube Aqua Charge Eye Drops / Silicone Sponge / Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam
<br>
</h6>


<p>The Nivea sunscreen is flat out amazing. I love the consistency and it's easy to apply. Western sunscreens need to step up their game.</p>

<p> I am also really liking the DHC lip balm I got. It's thick enough to apply lots of moisture to your lips without feeling overly sticky.</p> 

<p>The Kose Lip Gel Magic balm was something I bought out of impulse. It promised to keep your lipstick on hours after eating, drinking...etc. It definitely extends the wear of your lipstick but I haven't used it enough to see how long it truly lasts.</p>

<p>Japanese eye drops are on a whole new level. I even saw some slightly yellow tinted eyedrops to help combat the blue light from electronic devices...What a time to be alive, folks. I got the C3 eyedrops because of some great reviews online and I was totally sold on the cute and simple packaging. It makes wearing contacts actually enjoyable for me.</p>

<p>Silicone sponges are all over Instagram and I caved into the hype. I like to apply my foundation all over with this and then go in with some fine detail work with a disposable foam sponge. Two thumbs up for ease of cleanliness.</p>

<p><b>Daiso + It's Demo:</b></p>

<img src="/img/daiso.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
Daiso Impact Eyelashes #07 / Daiso Makeup Brush Cleaner / It's Demo x Missha M Magic Cushion #23 
<br>
</h6>


<p>Daiso and It's Demo are two completely different stores. Daiso makes all other dollar stores I've been to look obsolete. While It's Demo gave me vibes Claire's in the US might have given me. Except way classier and less middle school girls running around.</p>

<p> I am also really liking the DHC lip balm I got. It's thick enough to apply lots of moisture to your lips without feeling overly sticky.</p> 

<p>My mission at Daiso was to get my hands on the famous Makeup brush cleaner that's always out of stock. I managed to get enough bottles to last me a long time. It was easy to use and it left my makeup brushes squeaky clean. And at around 90 cents a bottle, you can't go wrong. In the same aisle I managed to find these gorgeous and natural looking lashes and you know I stocked up.</p>

<p>I ended up at It's Demo for one reason. There was an image that was surfacing around in the Asian beauty Instagram world. It was a picture of the cult classic Missha Cushion foundation with a limited edition Pokemon case. I had to get my hands on it. First of all the foundation itself is great on my skin and I ran out of it months back. Plus the packaging...I mean, COMMON, it's adorable. </p><br>

<h2>Korea</h2>

My husband and I did a quick little visit to Seoul once again to shop 'till we dropped. I ended up stocking up on old favorites and made some new discoveries. 

<!-- Innisfree -->

<p><b>Innisfree</b></p>

<img src="/img/innisfree.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br> It's Real Squeeze Masks / Ampoule Moisture Cushion #23 / Skinny Microcara / Waterproof Skinny Microcara / Auto Eyebrow Pencil /
Jeju Scent Picker Candle Set
<br>
</h6>


<p>Your girl right here is a DIE HARD FAN of Innisfree. I grabbed a basket and just started filling it up as soon as I walked into the door. 
</p>

<p> The face masks themselves are ok. They're very thin so it makes absorption to the skin quickly but I also ripped part of it by mistake just trying to get it out of the pouch.</p> 

<p>I live for the eyebrow pencils. They are smooth and make putting on my eyebrows in the morning a breeze. One pencil can last me up to 3 months! And I do my eyebrows almost every single day. It took everything in me to not get a lifetime supply all at once.</p>

<p> The skinny mascara line is quite good. I did really like the original formula but also added in the waterproof one for good measure. The tiny wand gets all the mascara fibers into every single eyelash. </p>

<p>My go-to winter cushion is the Ampule foundation from Innisfree. They had a 1 + 1 deal so of course, I put that in my basket.</p>

<p>I almost didn't get the candle collection until my husband snuck up behind me and mentioned I should just get them. I'm glad I did. They smell amazing and look great!</p><br>

<!-- Olive Young -->

<p><b>Olive Young</b></p>

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
Clio Tinted Tattoo Kill Brow / Clio Tattoo Lasting Gel Pencil / Clio Kill Cover Foundation #4 Ginger
<br>
</h6>

<p>Olive Young was having wild deals store wide when I was there. I managed to pick up a Clio foundation set on sale. It comes with the cushion foundation, a foundation refill as well as a primer.  I also managed to get some really good eyebrow products. My eyebrows stay in place when I use a combination of the two. Clio has some of my favorite Korean beauty products I've tried, these were no exception.
</p>
<br>

<!-- Skinfood -->

<p><b>Skinfood</b></p>

<img src="/img/skinfood.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
 Yuja Water Serum / Gold Caviar Collagen Serum / Nail Vita Nut Strengthener 
 / Nail Vita Pineapple Cuticle Cleaner / Pine Nut Cuticle Oil / Peach Cotton Pore Pact / Mini Eyebrow Tools
<br>
</h6>


<p>I love Yuja tea. When I saw that Skinfood carried and entire Yuja line I couldn't wait to try it. I got the Yuja serum and it smells amazing. I use it in the morning and night for an extra boost of hydration.</p>

<p> The gold caviar serum was mostly for my husband. He was in the market for night time skincare and he went with this as a serum option. More often than not reach out for this too. I can't help it. It smells wonderful and has little gold flecks so it feels ultra luxurious. </p> 

<p>My nail beds tend to be weak and brittle but ever since I started using the nail strengthener, cuticle cleaner and oil I saw a change. My nails look and feel healthier. </p>

<p>I recently ran out of my peach compact and couldn't wait to get my hands on another one. It keeps the oil at bay during my work day and is small enough to throw in my makeup bag without taking up too much space. 
</p>

<p>Since my eyebrows always gotta be done, I'm always in the market for small, portable tools that make my job easier. These two little babies do the job so well! I can really blend out the edges and shape my brows with ease.</p>

<!-- Nature Republic -->

<p><b>Nature Republic</b></p>

<img src="/img/nature_republic.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
 Hand &amp; Nature Sanitizer Gel /  Hand &amp; Nature Sanitizer Hand Cream
<br>
</h6>

<p>I use both of these products every single day. I made sure to stock up for the entire year because these are my lifeline, particularly in flu season. If you're looking for a good sanitizer/hand cream duo, this is it! Plus the scents are subtle and not overwhelming like most western brands.
</p>

<b>Products above</b>:<br>
MAC x Steve J. &amp; Yoni P. Collection 
<br>
</h6>


<p>The only thing I picked up at a MAC was a lipstick. The most perfect shade of peachy nude I've ever seen.  It's called Spotlight Me and it's from the MAC collaboration with Korean Designers Steve J and Yoni P. The products on this line were meant to showcase "Seoul street style made easy...". I know this collection was released globally but getting my hands on it in Seoul made it feel really special. </p>

<h2>Birthday Haul</h2>

Treat yo' self.

<!-- CVS -->

<p><b>CVS</b></p>

<img src="/img/cvs.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
Peach Slices Acne Spot Dots / The Saem Saemmul Wrapping Tint in PK01 / Wet + Wild Perfect Pout Gel Lip Liner in Think Flamingos / Peach Slices Face Masks

</h6>


<p>Can we talk about the Peach &amp; Lily Peach Slices x CVS collection really quick? ITS LIFE CHANGING. Go to your nearest CVS and stock up. The products are totally cute, and at an excellent price point. I'm so excited to see K-beauty become more accessible to everyone. There's a certain sense of comfort in me now knowing I can pick up cold medicine, Doritos, and k-beauty products at the CVS next door. </p> 

<p>I got a nasty cystic acne spot right on my chin and have been using the acne spot dots to calm down the redness, soak up any excess sebum and get my skin back on track. I will definitely be getting more. </p>

<p>Peel-off tints have been really popular on social media and I've been wanting to try them myself. The wrapping tint gel can be a little messy to use at first but once you peel off the tinted gel, THAT COLOR PAYOFF THO! I like using it as a base for the rest of my lip products. But it can definitely be used on its own. The default color is a beautiful rose shade.</p>

<p>The Wet N' Wild lip liner is the perfect companion to the MAC lipstick mentioned above. It's almost a dupe, to be honest. I'm so happy I picked this up on a whim.  </p>

<p>The Peach Slices sheet masks are a pretty good quality for less than $3 each. The packaging is so cute too!  </p>

<!-- Sephora -->

<p><b>Sephora</b></p>

<img src="/img/sephora.jpg" width="100%" height="auto">

<h6>
<b>Products above</b>:<br>
Clinique Shadow Palette in Wear Everywhere Nudes / Yves Saint Laurent Volupté Tint-In-Oil in Cherry My Cherie / Supergoop! Defense Refresh Setting Mist SPF 50 / GLAMGLOW SUPERCLEANSE Daily Clearing Cleanser / GLAMGLOW SUPERMUD Clearing Treatment / Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub with Sea Salt / Elizabeth and James Nirvana White / Buxom Plumpline Lip Liner in Hush Hush

<br>
</h6>


<p>Clinique eyeshadows were the first eyeshadows I ever owned. Why did I leave them? THEY ARE SO GREAT. I really wanted an everyday palette and this one looks so promising. </p>

<p> I had my eyes on the YSL tint for a while now. I got it as part of a mini sample 500 point YSL kit at Sephora a long time ago but since it was my birthday month, WHY NOT? It leaves lips looking juicy and supple. The color is really nice on my skin tone.</p> 

<p>The Supergoop setting SPF spray something that I was on the hunt for. I wanted something that would help me reapply SPF in the middle fo the day without having to use actual sunscreen and ruin my makeup. Shout out the amazing podcast and beauty community of Natch Beaut on Facebook! They suggested this setting spray and it's just what I was looking for. I probably would not suggest this being used by itself as the only source of sunscreen and a setting spray. It does have its flaws but for reapplying SPF between my commute from the office to straight home, it's just the thing. </p>

<p>My skin has been acting up lately. But GLAMGLOW TO THE RESCUE. I've had great success with the clearing treatment mask, I'm hoping the cleanser also proves to be a good product to keep in my arsenal against acne. 
</p>

<p>For my oily haired babes, the Christophe Robin Cleansing Shampoo is the BEST SHAMPOO I'VE USED FOR MY OILY HAIR. PERIOD. Try this out! Got this in my Sephora Play box a couple of months back and I've been so impressed how nice my hair feels after.  </p>

Needed a new scent for summer and picked up the Elizabeth and James Nirvana White perfume. The hype is real. It's so nice!

The almighty queen on K-Beauty, Pony, used the Buxom lippie in the shade "Hush Hush" in one of her tutorials recently and I had to get my hands on it. It's an awesome "my lip color, but better" shade on me.

<p>Hubby came thru and surprised me with the cutest little frames from Gentle Monster. I was in need of a new pair of glasses. I'm so excited to be adding these to my little Gentle Monster collection. </p>

Leather Pouch Wallet / Marfa bag
<br>
</h6>


<p>My wallet had a rough time keeping up with currency exchange on my honeymoon. I rarely use cash so having spare change, bills, subway cards, and random tickets on top of what I already carry popped the zipper on my old wallet. I desperately needed an upgrade. This simple wallet from Madewell can fit so much! When I was getting the wallet my eyes also wondered to a beautiful circular bag. Perfect combo!
