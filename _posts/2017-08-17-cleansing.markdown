<p>I've been getting acne like I've never had before recently. Whether it was hormonal, stress induced or because I wasn't eating properly, I had to see what I could do to keep these spots at bay. </p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed was that even after I double cleansed (oil and foam) I would pat my face down with a clean towel and there would still be very small traces of makeup.  I would grab a cotton pad and a toner to see if I could get the rest of it off but something had to give. No way I'm using two cleansers and not getting everything off. I'm already breaking out and I'm sure this is not making it any better. What am I doing wrong? </p>

<p>This summer, I purchased two things that really stepped up my cleansing game in a major way. </p>

<h2>1. Foreo Luna Mini</h2>

<p>To be clear, I have a Clarisonic. A Mia 2. I saved my little coins working multiple jobs in college to get one. At first, I was using it nonstop with no problems. When it came to change the replacement heads, I could see all the trapped gunk that was being left over from washing my face. Gross. The replacement heads are around $30 each and it's suggested you change them out every 3 months. I don't know about you, but I do not have the time nor the coin to buy them every quarter. So I did it the frugal way. I would buy a replacement head every year but after every use, I would clean that replacement head out with soap and warm water. Then wait for that brush head to dry. Because if I didn't, I knew there would be a high chance of it harboring bacteria. The fact that I even had to do this every time drove me crazy and eventually I stopped using my Clarisonic altogether. It's when I stopped using it that I'm assuming my cleansing issues began. </p>

<p>Foreo was having a 21% off sale on all products one day this summer and I caved in and got a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sephora.com/luna-mini-P387258?skuId=1633684">
Luna Mini</a>. It almost felt like an impulse buy. I didn't know if I made the right decision but as soon as I opened up that box and saw the little gray beauty, I knew. This thing is great. It's very similar to the Clarisonic which uses vibrations to clean your face deep down but also does its pulsating thing to tell you to move on to a different part of your face. My Luna Mini only comes with one setting which is fine for me. But I really like that it's made out of silicone so I can still wash it, dries in no time, and no worries of it harboring bacteria.</p>





<h2>2. Nooni Marshmellow Whip Foam Maker</h2>

<p>I love a good foam cleanser. A true, thick, foam. That's why I'm wild about the Shiseido Senka Perfect Whip Cleansing Foam. I mentioned it in my <a target="_blank" href="http://yeseniadeleon.com/2017/07/03/japan-korea-birthday-hauls.html">Japan/Korea haul blog post</a>. This thing was advertised everywhere and what really got me was the damn commercial. I couldn't find the exact one on youtube but all the commercials are similar: there's a woman in her bathroom, ready to cleanse and she brings up a GIGANTIC ball of foam right up to her whole face:</p>

<p>Although the cleanser is good by itself and provides an amazingly rich lather, there's no way you're getting that kind of foam action out of just using your hands. You gotta use a tool.  I noticed a lot of cosmetic places in Tokyo and Seoul had foaming nets for sale. They look like shower sponges that have lost their kink. And me being the germaphobe I am, I can't think of how to disinfect a foaming net. After some quick googles, I picked the Nooni Marshmallow Whip Foam Maker on Amazon. It's currently sold out there but I did track the same model, different color on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ulta.com/nooni-marshmallow-whip-maker-baby-pink?productId=xlsImpprod16361321#">Ulta</a>! Honey, this thing has changed my life.</p>

<p>I can create foam with just about any cleanser. I tried my Muji Milk Cleanser and even the good ol' Cetaphil cleanser. All with amazing results. </p>

<p>Plus this shit is so much fun to use! You just need to grab your foam maker, use a little bit of water:</p>

<p>A small amount of cleanser:</p>

<p>Pump, pump, pump it up! Voil&agrave; :</p>

<p>So far after a month of using this combination, my skin is getting better and no more tiny makeup residue on my towels! </p>
