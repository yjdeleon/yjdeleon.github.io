Winter is my least favorite season. It makes my skin feel like that time Spongebob went to Sandy's tree dome for the first time. Dry af. So I'm moisturizing like it's my full-time job. Here are my skincare picks that hold up to these nasty Boston winters. 


<b>1. CLINIQUEâ€¨</b><br>

CLINIQUE's Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is light and airy but packs a ton of moisture without making my skin feel greasy. I slap this on in the morning before I commute. It absorbs fast. This item can be a little pricey, but it's well worth the splurge in my book.  <br>


<b>2. Etude House </b><br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Etude-House-Moistfull-Collagen-Cream/dp/B006LWSAR6?th=1" target="_blank">Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream</a> <br>

The skin below the eyes is very thin, so it's important for me to keep that area moisturized. It helps me look fresh and awake, even if I didn't get enough sleep. This eye cream isn't too thick, so it's perfect for the morning.  <br>

<b>3. Vaseline</b><br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vaseline-Therapy-Advanced-Formula-Protectant/dp/B0002EZWO8?th=1" target="_blank"> Lip Therapy Tube Advanced Healing</a><br>

Chapped lips are the bane of my existence. But this little tube has become a lifesaver. I put this on in the morning and right before bed.  It leaves my lips feeling nice and hydrated for a long time.

<b>4. Nature Republic </b><br>
Hand & Nature Hand Sanitizer<br>

If you're clocking in some serious commuting time on public transit, like me, you know you need to keep hand sanitizer on deck.  Especially when flu season starts. You can buy hand sanitizers anywhere, but Nature Republic carries some of the most amazing scents. Finding these online can be a struggle, but every time I'm in LA or NYC, I stock up. <br>



<b>5. Nature Republic </b><br>
<a href="https://naturerepublicusa.com/shop/hand-nature-hand-cream-apple-mango/" target="_blank">Hand & Nature Hand Cream</a> <br>

This is one of those things that I cannot forget to throw in my bag every morning. Keys, cellphone, wallet, headphones, hand cream! My hands have been prone to cracking in the winter, but applying this on the regular has helped tremendously.  <br>


<b>6. Nature Republic  </b><br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Republic-Super-Combination-Watery/dp/B008191D30?th=1" target="_blank">Super Aqua Max Sleeping Pack</a> <br>

<img src="/img/sleeping_pack.png" height="320" width="320">

This sleeping pack works double time to make sure I wake up with hydrated skin. It also helps seal all the other oils and serums I use in my night time routine. I purchased a gigantic tub of this on my trip to Seoul nine months ago, and I still have a good amount left. <br>

What are your winter skin essentials? Let me know ;)
