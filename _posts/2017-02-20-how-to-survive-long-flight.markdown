Last year I took my first ever 14-hour flight from New York City to Seoul. I greatly underestimated how slow time seems to move up in the air. Since I'm right in the middle of planning another trip with a long haul flight, I figured I'd share my tips and tricks. 

<h2>1. Pick your airline and seat accordingly</h2>

<p>
Being well prepared for your long flight starts from the second you buy those plane tickets. I am constantly on <a href="https://www.skyscanner.com/" target="_blank">Skyscanner</a> to check out flight deals. I also make sure to have a tab open on <a href="http://www.airlinequality.com/" target="_blank">Skytrax</a> for airline reviews. Some foreign airlines have perks in economy class. We're talking slippers, toothbrush sets, the kind of stuff you usually find in business class. Depending on what airline you pick and what aircraft they use for your specific flight, the seat layout can be different. Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.seatguru.com/" target="_blank">SeatGuru</a> to make sure you're getting that seat you want! #TeamAisleSeat

<h2>2. Pack like a pro</h2>

<p>
Packing your carry-on is easy. There are plenty of tutorials online showing how to pack two weeks worth of clothes in a tiny 18 inch suitcse. It's your personal item, the one that is usually stored under your seat, that is key to maintaining sanity during a long flight. My personal item is usually a tote bag that I stuff with:   <br><br>

Ear plugs<br>
Eye mask<br>
Travel Pillow (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZIKWJW/ref=twister_B01M32OMAM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank"> Best $40 I've ever spent</a>)<br>
Blanket scarf<br>
Toiletries bag<br>
Baby Wipes<br>
Pen (for filling out those international slips)<br>
Entertainment<br>
Charger (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/BESTEK-Voltage-Converter-Travel-Adapter/dp/B012ERZ7B8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1487630934&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=voltage+converter&psc=1" target="_blank">international adaptors/converter too since some planes won't carry US voltage</a>)<br>
Snacks<br>
</p><br>

<h2>3. BYOS: bring your own snacks</h2>

<p>
My experience with food on long flights has been mixed. I loved the Bibimbap lunch from Asiana Airlines (Go ahead, judge me). But there were also some questionable food options too. (Burritos in a box anyone?) I usually pack a little paper lunch bag of snacks that will hold up well in a long flight. Trail mix, freeze dried fruit, chips, a granola bar and an instant cup noodle for something in between meal times (Just kindly ask your flight attendant for hot water). Remember that you still need to abide by the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/prohibited-items">TSA guidelines</a>. So don't bring an enrite meal with you.
</p><br>

<h2>4. Flight attendants are your BFFs</h2>

<p>
It's hard to keep it together as a traveler when you didn't sleep well the night before, you're stuck on Terminal 4 with other restless passengers, and you really wished you had eaten a salad instead of the Shake Shack you inhaled before you found out your flight was delayed. But there is no excuse to take your feelings out on the staff. Let me explain. Once that flight is boarded, flight attendants are your life support! You don't want to get off on the wrong foot with them, especially since you'll be seeing them constantly for all of the flight. Remember that the same rules of courtesy and respect that apply on the ground, apply in the air as well. And if you want to go the extra mile, bring a little chocolate for them. 
</p><br>

<h2>5. Bring entertainment, A LOT OF IT</h2>

<p>
You don't want to rely on the VOD on the plane or whatever the Hudson News stall is selling to get you through 14 hours. Bring a good book. Download all the podcast episodes you can. Download those movies and shows you're been meaning to watch on your laptop or tablet. While you're at it, download all your favorite songs too. I'M TALKING HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT HERE!!! If you're like me, you've been training for this moment since you got a Netflix account. This is the time to binge watch guilt free.
</p><br>

<h2>6. Hydrate and stretch </h2>

<p>
Being in a tin can full of recycled air for hours on end can make you feel miserable. Your skin starts to get dry, your nose and sinuses feel terrible and the neck pains kick in at around hour four of the flight. Make sure you stay hydrated with plenty of water and tea. Knock back an Airborne if you can. Take a little stroll through the ailes before headed to the bathroom. Stay healthy my friends. You don't want a cold that you cought on the airplane to ruin a vacation.
