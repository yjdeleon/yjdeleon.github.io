<p>Before I jump into my review, I just want to give credit where credit is due. I don't think I've ever been this excited for a makeup brand to launch. What really sold me was the diversity in her campaign. I wanted to test everything in person so I skipped the online launch. The Sephora I went to was fully stocked and I couldn't wait to get my hands on the products and fully have the Fenty Beauty experience. I'm so glad I went in store.</p>

<p>I walked in and saw at least 7 different folks looking at the Fenty Beauty display. All different. People with fair skin and fiery red hair, people with deep skin tones excited that they nailed picking out a shade of foundation on the first try. Young, old, tall, short, you name it. I had never seen anything like this before and it was such a wonderful experience. </p>

<p>The display itself....Bruh, THE PACKAGING. Lets quickly review the attention to detail up in this piece, shall we? </p>

<img src="/img/fenty/all_unboxed.JPG">

<p>It's a beautiful color that upon further research I found matches Pantone 7611 C...for all my designer nerds out there. The packaging on some of the items is magnetic. So you can throw them in your purse and they'll stay together as a little Fenty Beauty family. Super cool. I also love how luxurious the stained glass and shape of the foundation bottle feels. It probably sounds strange but next time you're at Sephora, go find this foundation and hold it in your hands. You'll know exactly what I'm talking about. </p>

<p>On to the actual products:</p>

<h2>1. Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation</h2>

<img src="/img/fenty/foundation.JPG">

<p>I wear foundation when I actually have time to apply it. Unfortunately, I'm the type to be running out the door and do my eyebrows on the bus headed to work. No shame. But because Rihanna did the damn thing and actually released shades in the widest range of colors my eyes have ever seen, I had to support this item. A Sephora babe (Shout out to Yaneli at the Fanuiel Hall location) helped me out with the shade range and application. I'm in shade 230. The foundation itself feels light weight and totally wearable for every day. It's a medium to full coverage foundation which I thought would be great since I've been breaking out a little on my forehead and hair line. </p>

<p>I've been wearing this foundation for the last three days.</p>

<p><b>Friday:</b></p>
<p>At Sephora, Yaneli applied the Fenty Beauty primer on me first. Which left my skin feelng very soft but that item wasn't on my list that day. Plus I'm sure you can get the same effect with a really good gel moisturizer. After getting matched, and buying the product I went about my day. It was fine at the office but I started to notice the foundation was sticking to dry patches on my skin due to the acne spot treatments I was doing earlier that week. By the time I went to class and came back home, the foundation had fully clung to my dry patches and looked very flaky. I didn't take any photos this day but I wish I did to show you how severe it looked. </p>>

<p><b>Saturday:</b></p>
<p>Started the day off by exfoliating my skin and making sure I was fully moisturized. I used Clio Kill Cover Primer and MAC Strobe Cream like I usually do. I applied the foundation with a Beauty Blender and then added A'PIEU Moist Creamy Concealer underneath my eyes, and other trouble spots. I lightly set everything with Too Faced Cocoa Powder Foundation. Added my brows and a glossy lip and I was ready to go. You can see mt face at 1 pm in the sunlight and then at 9 pm in my bathroom lighting.</p>

<p>This run was a lot better. Since I exfoliated the dry patches away and moisturized well, my skin looked great with the foundation on. I spent some time outside, really broke a sweat at some points and it held up. My face didn't look overly oily like it usually does end of the day so that was a huge plus.</p>


<p><b>Sunday:</b></p>
<p>I did the same routine as I mentioned above. Except for setting everything with my powder foundation because I wanted to try the Fenty Beauty Match Stix. I set everything this time around with my Aritaum Baby Face Collagen Mist and lightly tapped my face with clean fingers. </p>

<p>1:00 pm</p>

<p>Couldn't get a good closeup shot of how it looked at 9pm. My appologies! </p>

<p>I didn't do much except sit on the couch, reply to emails, write most of this blog post, watch some TV and clean the apartment. It defiantly held up again and did not get oily on me. </p>

<p>Overall, I like this foundation. If you have dry skin, you might want to skip this one. My face is on the oily side but since I had hormonal acne issues this past week, I used products to dry out my spots. That led to me having that patchiness so I probably won't be using this when my face is healing from PMS acne. It does oxidize so be mindful of that when picking up your shade. I suggest you get matched at Sephora, have an employee apply it on and run outside real quick, snap a photo or if you carry a mirror in your bag, even better. You'll be able to tell if you have a good match then since the lighting at some stores can be terrible. </p>

<p>I was hoping this would be as good as my favorites like Make Up For Ever Ultra HD or Clio Kill Cover foundation that I can use no matter how good or bad my skin is. But it still is a very nice finish. I can't believe how well it kept my skin from being an oily mess. I will be reaching for this when my face isn't acting up. </p>

<h2>2. Match Stix Trio in Medium</h2>

<img src="/img/fenty/trio.JPG">

<p>At the store I overheard an employee say that this trio pack gives you some bang for your buck. Each stick runs around $25 USD. The pack comes with three shades and they retail for $54. Ok, I know that's not necessarily cheap but I wanted to give these a try but I am not spending $75 for three when I can just buy a trio set. </p>

<p>I was suggested the Medium set based on skin tone. When Yaneli finished applying the foundation she first applied the Match Stix by rolling them on my face and taking in a smaller brush and blending them out. It didn't take long to realize that the brush just wasn't doing the trick. Instead, she opted for some clean fingers and lightly patting them in my cheeks. </p>

<p>The colors that come in the Medium set are Bamboo (the concealer), Mocha (the contour shade), and Trippin' (the highlight). </p>

<p>Yaneli and I figured out that if you apply these bad boys like neapolitan ice cream ...DASSSS IT. It's flawless. Bamboo as the vanilla on the high points of my cheekbones, then the Trippin' shade as the strawberry middle acting as a blush and then mocha as the chocolate being my contour. </p>

<p>I love how easy these are to apply with your fingers. They melt just enough to glide on to your skin. The color pay off is so rich too. Just the slightest amount gives off a lot of pigment. I had them on for 8 hours and the color was still there!</p>

<h2>3. Invisimatte Blotting Paper</h2>

<img src="/img/fenty/papers.JPG">

<p>*Eye roll* I don't even know where to begin.
I was so excited to see this line was carrying blotting papers. Because my skin is usually an oily mess by 2 pm and it looks like you can fry an egg on my forehead, I am always in the market for something to keep the oil at bay. My Shiseido ones that I love come in an awkward flimsy sleeve that gets gross in my makeup bag, so when I saw these papers coming in some amazing packaging I knew I had to have them. </p>

<p>As soon as I loaded up the container with the blotting paper roll, and tried to rip a sheet off, I can't get a clean cut. I tried to open it up again to see what was going on the piece of plastic holding the roll together popped off.  You can pop it back in but it makes me think this is some shotty packaging. </p>

<img src="/img/fenty/mirror.JPG">

<p>After watching the video of a makeup artist using these on the Sephora product page, I can get a clean cut but I have to roll out a large amount of paper to do so.</p>

<p>I like the papers themselves. They're a beautiful color and I like that you can pick the size you want but the fact that I had such a hard time figuring this packaging out turned me off. I wanted to LOVE this product. I'm not sure if I'm gonna exchange this one (maybe I got a slightly defected item and should give it anoher try) or if I should just return it for a refund. </p>
